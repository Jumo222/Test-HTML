This project is for learning purposes.

I have some technical knowledge, but am in general a novice when it comes to the technical side of web sites and web applications. I want to understand how they work on a technical level.

Part of it is that I'm using developer mode in Chrome and trying to understand what all this information tells me.

## Current Project Status
This is a web development learning project built with modern React and TypeScript:

### Tech Stack
- **React 18** - Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Router** - Client-side routing (SPA navigation)
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS** - Traditional styling (styles.css)

### Project Structure
- `src/` - React source code
  - `main.tsx` - Application entry point
  - `App.tsx` - Main app component with routing
  - `pages/` - Page components (Home, About, Addition)
  - `components/` - Reusable React components
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks (useInteractivity.ts)
- `tests/` - Playwright end-to-end tests
- `dist/` - Production build output (generated by Vite)
- `index.html` - Root HTML file (loads React app)

### Features
- Single-page application (SPA) with React Router
- Interactive components: color changer, click counter, message display, addition calculator
- Custom hooks for state management
- Comprehensive test suite with Playwright (accessibility, cross-browser, visual regression)
- Hot module replacement (HMR) in development

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server (port 3000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (TypeScript check + Vite build)
- `npm test` - Run Playwright tests

### Migration History
The project was migrated from vanilla HTML/JavaScript to React (v3.0), with old files removed. The TypeScript implementation now uses React components and hooks instead of direct DOM manipulation.
