This project is for learning purposes.

I have some technical knowledge, but am in general a novice when it comes to the technical side of web sites and web applications. I want to understand how they work on a technical level.

Part of it is that I'm using developer mode in Chrome and trying to understand what all this information tells me.

## Current Project Status
This is a web development learning project that includes:
- HTML files (index.html, about.html) for basic structure
- CSS styling (styles.css)
- TypeScript development (src/script.ts) with TypeScript configuration
- Build tooling setup with package.json and dist/ output
- Version control with Git

The project appears to be transitioning from vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript as part of the learning process, with the original script.js moved to Trash/ and replaced with TypeScript implementation in src/.
