## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:headed

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test navigation.spec.ts

# Run tests for specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Debug mode
npm run test:debug
```

### Test Categories
```bash
# Run specific test categories
npx playwright test accessibility
npx playwright test visual-regression
npx playwright test performance
npx playwright test e2e-user-flows
```

### CI/CD Commands
```bash
# Run tests in CI mode
CI=true npx playwright test

# Generate and view reports
npm run test:report
```

## Configuration

### Browser Configuration
The test suite runs on:
- **Chromium** (Desktop & Mobile)
- **Firefox** (Desktop)  
- **Webkit/Safari** (Desktop & Mobile)

### Viewports
- Desktop: 2560x1271 (4K 150%)
- iPhone 15: Mobile viewport
- Galaxy S24: Mobile viewport

### Test Timeouts
- Default: 30 seconds
- Animation waits: 500ms-1000ms
- Page loads: NetworkIdle + 500ms

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Page Object Model
- Reusable page classes in `test-config.ts`
- Centralized element selectors
- Abstracted user actions

### 2. Test Data Management
- Centralized test data in `TEST_CONFIG`
- Parameterized test scenarios
- Reusable test utilities

### 3. Stability Practices
- Proper wait strategies (networkidle, animations)
- Retry mechanisms for flaky elements
- Robust selectors using IDs and semantic elements

### 4. Maintainability
- Descriptive test names
- Organized test structure
- Shared utilities and helpers
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Parallel test execution
- Artifact uploads (reports, traces, screenshots)
- Multiple test environments

## Test Reporting

### HTML Reports
- Comprehensive test results
- Screenshots and traces on failures
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility violation details

### Artifacts
- Test traces for debugging
- Screenshots for visual regression
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility reports

## Debugging

### Local Debugging
```bash
# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test navigation.spec.ts --debug

# Use UI mode for interactive debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Generate trace files
npx playwright test --trace on
```

### CI Debugging
- Check uploaded artifacts in GitHub Actions
- Review test traces and screenshots
- Monitor performance metrics
- Accessibility violation reports

## Maintenance

### Visual Regression Updates
When UI changes are intentional:
```bash
# Update screenshots
npx playwright test visual-regression --update-snapshots
```

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Use page object models from `test-config.ts`
3. Include appropriate test categories
4. Add proper documentation

### Performance Baselines
Review and update performance thresholds in `performance.spec.ts` as the application evolves.
